Iam valentine cherutich a kenyan citizen i
 finished my 'o'level in the year 2020 in brightlight secondary school kajiado and i
  engaged myself in a retail business for 1year
   which it enabled me to work with different kind of people.
  Working with different kind of people was bit challenging 
  as everyone of them had there own different ideas when it comes to job 
   which made me develop a self intrest in doing business.
   My experience is that i can do any job on my own and also i can volunteer.
   since iam taking  a software engineering cource i know it will expand my career job of being a software marketer.
